            <h3 id="fastest">Fastest cars</h3>
            <p>The first production car with a recorded speed was the 1894 Benz Velo that had a top speed of just 12
                mph. Few verified
                records exist from that point until around 1950, when the Jaguar XK120 set a production car speed record
                of 124.6 mph
                (not to be confused with the tuned prototype that managed to hit 133 mph) From this point on, it became
                a trend for
                automotive publications to do their own top speed test. Even the venerable McLaren F1 was tested by Car
                & Driver, and in
                2005 we got our first government-official speed record set by the Bugatti Veyron EB 16.4 and verified by
                German
                inspection officials in 2005. It was that moment when the official challenge between manufacturers
                kicked off, and since
                then there have only been a handful of cars up to breaking the record.
